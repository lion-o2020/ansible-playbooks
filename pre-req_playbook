## A N S I B L E  playbook for installing Stealth's prequisites, which include various libraries,   #  utilities and programs in the form of rpm packages. Some conflicting 'Swan' packages are         #  removed as well, but Stealth will install it's own. Both pre-req installs and removals           #  are required, along with ensuring your target server(s) are properly registered with our RedHat  #  Satellite remote server.
